                    <p>Pontianak is the capital city of West Kalimantan, situated on the island of Borneo in Indonesia. Founded in 1771, it initially began as a trading port and eventually became the chief gold city of Borneo. Located near the equator, Pontianak occupies approximately 118 square kilometers in the delta of the Kapuas River, which meets its major tributary, the Landak River. The city is known as "Kota Khatulistiwa" (Equatorial City) because it straddles the Earth's equator.

            <h2 class="index2">West Borneo</h2>
            <p> known as Kalimantan Barat, is one of the five provinces of Indonesia located on the island of Borneo. It covers an area of approximately 147,037 square kilometers and is bordered by Central Kalimantan to the southeast, East Kalimantan to the east, and the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the north. The capital city is Pontianak, which lies on the equator, making it a significant geographical landmark.</p> 
            <p class="titleHeader">Geography and Climate</p>
            <p>West Kalimantan is characterized by its extensive network of rivers, earning it the nickname "The Province of a Thousand Rivers." The major rivers include the Kapuas, Landak, and Pawan rivers, which are vital for transportation and trade. The region features low-lying swampy lands interspersed with hilly areas, particularly in the Muller and Schwaner mountain ranges. The climate is tropical, with high humidity and significant rainfall throughout the year, contributing to its lush rainforest ecosystems.</p>
            <p class="titleHeader">Demographics</p>
            <p>As of mid-2023, West Kalimantan's population is estimated to be around 5.6 million people. The province is ethnically diverse, primarily inhabited by various indigenous groups collectively known as the Dayak, along with Malays and Chinese communities. This cultural diversity is reflected in local traditions, languages, and festivals.</p>
            <p class="titleHeader">Economy</p>
            <p>The economy of West Kalimantan is largely based on agriculture, with rice, corn, and cassava being staple crops. Additionally, small-scale industries produce palm oil, rubber, and handicrafts. Despite its rich natural resources, infrastructure development has been slow; rivers remain crucial for internal transport due to limited road connectivity.</p>
            <p class="titleHeader">Biodiversity</p>
            <p>West Kalimantan is home to rich biodiversity, including dense rainforests that support a wide variety of flora and fauna. The region hosts endemic species such as orangutans and proboscis monkeys. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these habitats from deforestation and environmental degradation.</p>
            <p>Overall, West Kalimantan is a region of significant ecological and cultural importance within Indonesia, showcasing a blend of natural beauty and diverse communities.</p>
