Located near the equator, Pontianak occupies approximately 118 square kilometers in the delta of the Kapuas River, which meets its major tributary, the Landak River. The city is known as "Kota Khatulistiwa" (Equatorial City) because it straddles the Earth's equator.

Cultural richness is evident in local festivals and cuisine, making Pontianak a vibrant hub for both residents and visitors. Notable attractions include the Equator Monument and various natural parks that showcase the region's lush biodiversity.

                <p class="mainTitle">Equator Monument</p>
                <p>Tugu Khatulistiwa, also known as the Equator Monument, is a significant landmark located in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. This monument marks the spot where the equator passes through the city, making Pontianak one of the few cities in the world situated directly on the equatorial line.</p>
                <p class="titleHeader"> Historical Background</p>
                <p>The construction of Tugu Khatulistiwa began in 1928, initiated by a geographic expedition led by a Dutch geographer. The original structure was a simple post marked with an arrow indicating the equatorial line. Over the years, it has undergone several renovations and enhancements: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1930</strong>: The first improvement included adding a circular base and an arrow.</li>
                        <li><strong>1938</strong>: Architect Friedrich Silaban redesigned the monument, incorporating four pillars made from belian wood (a type of ironwood), with varying heights.</li>
                        <li><strong>1990-1991</strong>: A protective dome was constructed around the original monument, significantly enlarging its size—five times larger than the original. This new structure was inaugurated on September 21, 1991.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                The current monument features two front pillars standing 15.25 meters tall and two rear pillars reaching 22 meters, with a large arrow pointing north-south to signify the equatorial line</p>
                <p class="titleHeader">Architectural features</p>
                <p>Tugu Khatulistiwa consists of: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Four belian wood pillars</strong>: Two front pillars are 3.05 meters tall, while the rear pillars reach up to 4.4 meters.</li>
                        <li><strong>A circular base</strong>: Inscribed with "EVENAAR," which means equator in Dutch, indicating its significance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Directional arrow</strong>: The monument includes a prominent arrow that indicates north-south alignment at latitude 0°.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                Inside the dome, visitors can find historical photographs and educational displays about astronomy and geography, including information about celestial bodies and their relation to Earth</p>
